# Atmoce_modbus_HA
Atmoce Modbus configuration for Home Assistant

I've recently purchased Atmoce Microinverters, gateway (combiner) and battery. 

I'm sharing this in the hope it is helpful for anyone else who acquires this system, and I hope furhter that someone with greater understanding of modbus than me can take it and adapt it to make it more useful. 
My modbus understanding is limited to reading values, the Atmoce implementation also allows R/W commands to set battery to discharge/charge etc which I'll eventually have a go at.
